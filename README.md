#### Brief Description of Project - 
 "Care & Cure" is a private hospital that has recently been started by few veterans in the industry with 
high demand, a significant customer base, and a reputation." Care & Cure" hospital management 
system is an integrated web application that handles different directions of clinic workflows. It manages 
smooth healthcare performance along with administrative, medical, legal, and financial control. That is 
a cornerstone for the successful operation of healthcare and facility. This hospital management system 
provides certain automation of many vital daily processes. And this will be covered all the services that 
unify and simplify the work of healthcare professionals as well as their interactions with patients."Care 
& Cure" management requires a software system to manipulate its resources in a very efficient manner 
and connect them to maximize profits for its owners or stakeholders while maintaining corporate social 
responsibility. It was identified that the following requirements should be met through the system. We 
are most concerned about the current situation in the country and then finding the solutions for the 
problems the patients have to face during this situation. Therefore we decided to build a patient-doctor 
face-to-face clinical service using an online platform.
